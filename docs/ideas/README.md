This is a place for new development ideas.

Contributions are welcome. If you have new idea or would like to refine some of
the existing make a fork of the repo, do your changes and send me a pull
request. For discussion there is the [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/textx-talk) but we can use commit
comments or issues as well.
