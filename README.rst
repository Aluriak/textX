textX
=====

|pypi-badge| |license| |build-status| |docs|

textX is a meta-language for building Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) inspired
by `Xtext`_.  From a single language description (grammar) textX will build a
parser and a meta-model (a.k.a. abstract syntax) for the language.

textX follows the syntax and semantics of Xtext but differs in some places and is
implemented 100% in Python using `Arpeggio`_ parser.
It is fully dynamic - no code generation at all!
