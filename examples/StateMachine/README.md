This textX example is based on the example from the [Martin Fowler's]() [book on
DSLs]().

File `state_machine.tx` is the grammar of the language. State machine instances
are given in files `miss_grant_controller.sm` and  `gate.sm`.

`miss_grant_controller.sm` is original example from Fowler's book.

`gate.sm` is a simple state machine model of a gate that unlocks by inserting
a coin and locks again when someone pass trough the gate.

Images for meta-model and models are generated by textx command and dot tool.

    $ textx visualize state_machine.tx miss_grant_controller.sm
    $ textx visualize state_machine.tx gate.sm
    $ dot -Tpng -O *.dot
