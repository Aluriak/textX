This textX example is based on the example from the [Martin
Fowler's](http://www.martinfowler.com/aboutMe.html) [book on
DSLs](http://www.martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html).

File `state_machine.tx` is the grammar of the language. State machine instances
are given in files `miss_grant_controller.sm` and  `gate.sm`.

`miss_grant_controller.sm` is the original example from Fowler's book.

`gate.sm` is a simple state machine model of a gate that unlocks by inserting
a coin and locks again when someone pass trough the gate.

Script `state_machine.py` is model interpreter. You can run models by the
following command:

    $ python state_machine.py miss_grant_controller.sm
    $ python state_machine.py gate.sm

Images for meta-model and models are generated by textx command and dot tool.

    $ textx visualize state_machine.tx miss_grant_controller.sm
    $ textx visualize state_machine.tx gate.sm
    $ dot -Tpng -O *.dot
