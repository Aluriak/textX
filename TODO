textX TODO
----------

  - tests
  - docs
  - More flexible match rules.
    Match rules should consists of alternative choice of sequences of str
    matches, regex matches and other match rules.
  - Support for custom classes.
    Currently, classes are created by the textX based on the rule names.
    User should be able to supply a dict of classes that should be used instead.
  - Better error reporting.
    For example, if match fails at attribute assignment the name of the attribute
    should be reported not the name of the rule.
  - Match classes (to support syntax highlighting in editors)
  - Match span beside position (e.g. to support navigation from visual
    representation to textual).
  - Checking of assignments inside repetitions (*, +).
    If a plain assignment is inside repetition check that assignment is called
    at most one. Better detection of multiplicities.
